    <hl>Corgis Data - State Fragility Global Report 2014 </hl>
    <p>The data used in this web app was accesed from the CORGIS Dataset Project and is accesable at their webgsite.
	    This dataset shows information on state fragility globally from states with a populatin of 500,000 or more in 2013. To understand the data I will have included below the analysis of methodology that the Systemic Peace organisation used to collect and rate the data.</p> 
    <p> The following technical notes are found at: http://www.systemicpeace.org/vlibrary/GlobalReport2014.pdf </p>
	    <h1>  TECHNICAL NOTES TO THE STATE FRAGILITY INDEX AND MATRIX: </h1>
		    <p>The State Fragility Index and Matrix 2013 lists all independent countries in the world in which the total country population is greater than 500,000 in 2013 (167 countries). The Fragility Matrix scores each country on both Effectiveness and Legitimacy in four performance dimensions: Security, Political, Economic, and Social, at the end of the year 2013. Each of the Matrix indicators is rated on a four-point fragility scale: 0 “no fragility,” 1 “low fragility,” 2 “medium fragility,” and 3 “high fragility” with the exception of the Economic Effectiveness indicator, which is rated on a five-point fragility scale (including 4 “extreme fragility”). The State Fragility Index, then, combines scores on the eight indicators and ranges from 0 “no fragility” to 25 “extreme fragility.” A country’s fragility is closely associated with its state capacity to manage conflict; make and implement public policy; and deliver essential services and its systemic resilience in maintaining system coherence, cohesion, and quality of life; responding effectively to challenges and crises, and sustaining progressive development.</p>
		    <p>Fragility Indices
State Fragility Index = Effectiveness Score + Legitimacy Score (25 points possible)
Effectiveness Score = Security Effectiveness + Political Effectiveness + Economic Effectiveness + Social Effectiveness (13 points possible)
Legitimacy Score = Security Legitimacy + Political Legitimacy + Economic Legitimacy + Social Legitimacy (12 points possible)</p>
		    <p>General Notes: The State Fragility Index and Matrix was originally introduced in “Global Report on Conflict, Governance, and State Fragility 2007.” In order to standardize procedures for scoring each of the eight component indicators to make the indicators and indices comparable across time, we set threshold values for the categorical fragility scores based on cutpoints derived from values in a baseline year (2004). This methodology effects continuous measures used for Economic Effectiveness (GDP per capita in constant 2005 US dollars); Economic Legitimacy (manufacturing exports as a percent of merchandise exports); Social Effectiveness (human development indicator; HDI); and Social Legitimacy (infant mortality rate); baseline specifications are provided in the relevant indicator explanations that follow. Social Effectiveness scores were revised slightly due to a change in the formulation of the Human Development Index by the UNDP Human Development Report in 2010. The Economic Effectiveness indicator was rescaled in 2009 and a fifth value was added to denote “extreme fragility” in countries that have a GDP per capita of $500 or less (constant 2005 US$). As the World Bank regularly revises historical, country-level GDP and periodically adjusts "constant" GDP figures to a new base year, we recode the entire time series of the Economic Effectiveness indicator annually using the most recent GDP figures provided by the World Bank; this may result in some changes to historical indicators and indices in the time-series data set. In addition, a fourth indicator was added in 2008 to the calculation of the Political Legitimacy Score (scores for all previous years have been recalculated; state fragility scores have been calculated for all countries annually beginning with 1995).As several of the Matrix indicatorsuse “most recent year available” data, the Matrix scores are carried forward and adjusted when new data becomes available; see details below.</p>
		    <p>Security Indicators
Security Effectiveness (“seceff”) Score: Total Residual War, a measure of general security and vulnerability to political violence, 1989-2013 (25 years). Source: Monty G. Marshall, Major Episodes of Political Violence, 1946-2013, (www.systemicpeace.org), variable name “actotal.” The formula to calculate this score is based on two assumptions: (1) the residual effects of low level and/or short wars diminish relatively quickly; and (2) the residual effects of serious or protracted wars diminish gradually over a 25-year period. Three indicators are used to calculate each country’s “residual war” score (reswartot): warsum1-4 (sum of annual scores for all wars in which the country is directly involved for each continuous period of armed conflict); yrnowar1-3 (interim years of “no war” between periods of armed conflict); and yrpeace (years of peace, or no war, since the end of most recent war period). For states with one war episode: reswartot = warsum – [yrpeace + (0.04yrpeace x warsum)]. For countries with multiple periods of war, a reswar value is calculated for each, in chronological order. Thus, for a state with two episodes of war, to calculate the first episode: reswar1 = warsum1 – [yrnowar1 + (0.04yrnowar1 x warsum1)]; and for the second episode: reswartot = (reswar1 + warsum2) – {yrpeace + [.04yrpeace x (reswar1 + warsum1)]}; and so on. Any negative residual war (reswar) scores are converted to zero before calculating additional residual war scores. The final reswartot value is then converted to a four-point fragility scale, where: 0 = 0; 1 = 0.1-15; 2 = 15.1-100; and 3 = greater than 100.
Security Legitimacy (“secleg”) Score: State Repression, a measure of state repression, 1999-2012. Source: Mark Gibney, Linda Cornett, and Reed Wood, Political Terror Scale (PTS; www.politicalterrorscale.org). The PTS provides separate annual indicators drawn from U.S. State Department and Amnesty International reports; each indicator is coded on a five-point scale, from 1: “no repression” to 5: “systemic, collective repression.” To determine the state repression score, we calculate the following: (1) nine-year average, 1999- 2007; (2) four-year average, 2008-2011; and (3) most recent value, 2012; the three, mean indicators are then compared according to a fragility categorization: 0 = 1.0-2.0; 1 = 2.1-3.0; 2 = 3.1-4.0; and 3 = greater than 4.0. If the most recent year value agrees with the previous four-year average, then these two means are used to identify the repression category. When the most recent year score is not in agreement with the previous period, then the earlier nine-year mean is used to help determine a more general pattern in state repression. Historical treatments, that is, calculations of Security Legitimacy Scores for previous years, are further aided by reference to patterns in “future” PTS values. The exact year of change in the general practice of state repression and, so, the Security Legitimacy Score can be more confidently identified in the historical treatment. Because the calculated value on this indicator is based on year 2012 data, the indicator value is assigned to the 2012 Matrix “secleg” score and that score is carried forward to the 2013 Matrix.</p>
		    <p>Political Indicators
Political Effectiveness (“poleff”) Score: Regime/Governance Stability, 1997-2013. Sources: Monty G. Marshall, Keith Jaggers, and Ted Robert Gurr, Polity IV Project: Political Regime Characteristics and Transitions, 1800- 2013; Henry S. Bienen and Nicolas van de Walle, Leadership Duration (updated by Monty G. Marshall); and Monty G. Marshall and Donna Ramsey Marshall, Coups d’Etat, 1946-2013, datasets (www.systemicpeace.org). Three indicators are used to calculate the Regime/Governance Stability score: Regime Durability (Polity IV, 2013); Current Leader’s Year’s in Office (Leadership Duration, 2013); and Total Number of Coup Events 1998- 2013, including successful, attempted, plotted, alleged coups and forced resignations or assassinations of chief executives, but not including coup events associated with Polity adverse regime changes (these major regime changes cause the “durability” score to be reset to “0” and, so, would be double-counted, see above). These indicators are scored such that: Durability < 10 years = 1; Leader Years in Office > 12 years = 1; and Total Coup Events: 1-2 = 1 and >2 = 2. These indicators are then added to produce the Regime/Governance Stability score (scores of 4 are recoded as 3). Note: Countries coded in the Polity IV dataset as an “interregnum” (i.e., total or near total collapse of central authority, −77) for the current year are scored 3 on the Political Effectiveness indicator.</p>
		    <p>Political Legitimacy (“polleg”) Score: Regime/Governance Inclusion, 2013. Sources: Polity IV, 2013; Ted Robert Gurr, Monty G. Marshall, and Victor Asal, Minorities at Risk Discrimination 2013 (updated by Monty G. Marshall); and Ted Robert Gurr and Barbara Harff, Elite Leadership Characteristics 2013 (updated by Monty G. Marshall). In the 2007 report, four indicators were used to determine the Regime/Governance Inclusion score: Factionalism (Polity IV, parcomp value 3 = 1); Ethnic Group Political Discrimination against 5% or more of the population (Discrimination: POLDIS values 2, 3, 4 = 1); Political Salience of Elite Ethnicity (Elite Leadership Characteristics: ELETH values 1 or 2 = 1); and Polity Fragmentation (Polity IV, fragment value greater than 0 = 1). To these indicators, we have added Exclusionary Ideology of Ruling Elite (Elite Leadership Characteristics: ELITI value 1 = 1). Political Legitimacy Score is calculated by adding these five indicators; scores of 4 or 5 (rare) are recoded as 3.</p>
		    <p>Economic Indicators
Economic Effectiveness (“ecoeff”) Score: Gross Domestic Product per Capita (constant 2005 US$), 2006-2012. Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators, 2014 (www.worldbank.org/data). The annual values for the past seven years are reviewed to verify that the value in the most recent year is consistent with values in previous years and that a threshold/category change in a country’s GDP per capita indicator score is part of a consistent trend and not simply a short-term aberration from that trend. The value for the most recent year (2012) is coded into a five-point fragility scale, based on cut-points derived from the threshold values for the fit of the State Fragility Index and GDP per capita in a baseline year (2005). The standardized categories are as follows: 4 = less than $500.00; 3 = $500.00 to $1199.99; 2 = $1200.00 to $2999.99; 1 = $3000.00 to $7499.99; and 0 = greater than or equal to $7500. When a country’s 2012 value exceeds the borderline value separating categories, the fifteen-year income growth indicator is used to assign the final score: selecting the higher fragility category if long-term growth is negative or the lower fragility category if long-term growth is positive. Because the calculated value on this indicator is based on year 2012 data, the indicator value is assigned to the 2012 Matrix “ecoeff” score and that score is carried forward to the 2013 Matrix. Note: These cutpoint values and the baseline year differ from previous versions of the Global Report due to revisions made by the World Bank in contemporary and historical data with the 2014 version of the data series: standardized categories are revised to conform with the change to "constant 2005 US$" and revised GDP figures were retro- coded for prior years, 1995–2011, in the SFI time-series dataset in May 2014.
Economic Legitimacy (“ecoleg”) Score: Share of Export Trade in Manufactured Goods, 1998-2012. Source: UN Development Programme, Structure of Trade, 2014, and World Bank, World Development Indicators (WDI), 2014, (manufacturing as a percentage of merchandise exports). Merchandise exports include two classes of products: manufactured goods and primary commodities; low percentage of manufactured goods indicates a high reliance on primary commodities for foreign exchange. The annual values of this variable are examined to ensure that the most recent annual value is a representative value within the established range for that country. The manufacturing percentage of merchandise exports is then converted to a four-point fragility score, where: 3 = less than or equal to 10; 2 = greater than 10 and less than or equal to 25; 1 = greater than 25 and less than or equal to 40; and 0 = greater than 40. Because the calculated value on this indicator is based on year 2012 data, the indicator value is assigned to the 2012 Matrix “ecoleg” score and that score is carried forward to the 2013 Matrix. The world’s main illicit drug producing/supplying countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), and Columbia are given the highest value (3) on this indicator</p>
		    <p>Social Indicators
Social Effectiveness (“soceff”) Score: Human Capital Development, 2012. Source: UNDP Human Development Report 2012, Human Development Index (HDI), 2012 (www.undp.org). Reported HDI values are converted according to a four-point fragility scale based on the cut-points of the lower three HDI quintiles in the baseline year, 2004. The Social Effectiveness Score is assigned as follows: 3 = less than or equal to .400; 2 = greater than .400 and less than or equal to .600; 1 = greater than .600 and less than or equal to .700; and 0 = greater than .700. Because the calculated value on this indicator is based on year 2012 data, the indicator value is assigned to the 2012 Matrix “soceff” score and that score is carried forward to the 2013 Matrix. Note: These cutpoints differ from those reported in the 2007 - 2009 editions of Global Report. This is due to a change in the formulation of the Human Development Index reported in the UNDP Human Development Report beginning in 2010. The new UNDP report provides scores for earlier years and orders countries similarly across the two (old and new) formulations of the HDI; thus the two indices could be combined to provide consistent coverage annually for the entire period, 1995-2012.
Social Legitimacy (“socleg”) Score: Human Capital Care, 2013. Source: US Census Bureau, International Data Base, 2014, (IDB; www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb), Infant Mortality Rate, 2013. This indicator is based on the infant mortality rate (number of deaths of infants under one year of age from a cohort of 1,000 live births), with values converted to a four-point fragility scale based on the upper cut-points of the lower three quintiles of the infant mortality rates in the baseline year, 2004. The Social Legitimacy Score is assigned as follows: 3 = greater than 75.00; 2 = less than or equal to 75.00 and greater than 45.00; 1 = less than or equal to 45.00 and greater than 20.00; and 0 = less than or equal to 20.00. These scores are then adjusted according to ranking comparisons between the country’s income level (GDP per capita) and human capital development (HDI). If the country’s HDI ranking among the 165 countries listed is more than twenty-five places above its GDP per capita ranking (meaning it provides better human capital care than expected by its level of income) the Social Legitimacy Score (fragility) is lowered by one point. If HDI ranking is more than twenty-five places below GDP per capita ranking, the fragility score is increased by one point.</p>
		    <h1> Website Authors Notes </h1>
		    <p>Due to the huge scope of the statistical study, material and social conditions in their complex relationships were fairly discarded in the logging of this data. For instance, to rate social legitimacy the authors choose to only use infant mortality rates. This is a slap in the face of state theory that, to put simply, does not equate child birth rates to state social legitimacy. A similar analysis can be done to the social effectiveness stats. Based up HDI, which has its own rage of averaging problems that disreguards inequalities and global explolitation within its analysis. It is a general broad big data project used within a different similar project. Neither are a complete picture but rather an extremely simplified view simply for the use of global analysis. Nuance is therefore neccesary to develop a wholesome analysis.  </p>
